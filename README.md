# DSA4262-Project-2
*The following showcases 2 sets of instructions - 1 set of instruction to train a model and use that model to predict, while the other set is solely talking about how to use a model (gradientboostingclassifier.sav) for prediction.*

**1. For coursemates to follow along - prediction using model**
1. Click on the green **Code** button and select the option *Download ZIP* to download the scripts and csv files into local environment.
2. Once the zip file has been downloaded, drag the file into the directory of your choice.
3. After the file has been dragged into the directory, click one level into the zip file and drag the folder that you see into the parent directory.
4. With this, we can open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory that the notebook, csv file and model (gradientboostingclassifier.sav) are in.
5. In order to do predictions using the model that has been trained, open up **Project 2 - Prediction Script for Github** and run all the codes. At the end of the script, the predictions for the test dataset (*test_set_github.csv*) will be produced.
